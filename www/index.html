    <p>The UNCo Heliostat is a solar imaging platform designed and implemented by UNCo Physics students. The project has continued in one form or another since the mid 1990s, and many students have contributed over the years. However, transfer of knowledge has made it difficult for new students to continue work left behind by previous generations.</p>
    
    <p>The short term goal of this project is to put the Heliostat in working order for research applications. This effort will include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>repairs and minor modifications to the hardware;</li>
      <li>design and implementation of an easy to use software interface;</li> 
      <li>and the development of extensive online documentation.</li> 
    </ul>  
    <p>The longer term goal of this project is to provide future students with a platform for advanced research in solar science, e.g. spectrometry and sun spots.

<p>This project is actively seeking interested students who want to gain experience in mechanical and electrical design, software development, project management, and documentation. Contact  <a href="https://github.com/pack3754">Daniel Packard </a> or <a href="https://github.com/mowoodsiii">Maurice Woods</a> to find out more.</p>

<p>To make the project more accessible to new users, all existing hardware design, software, and documentation (including the source for this web page) have been compiled into a github repository. Visit the page on github (<a href="http://github.com/pack3754/unco-heliostat">Heliostat on Github</a>) to find out more. </p>
        
<p>You can clone your own copy of the to start using/contributing to the project right away! For example, on Linux you would issue the following command from the command line: </p>

<p><code>
  $ git clone http://github.com/pack3754/unco-heliostat.git
</code></p>


<!--BOOKMARK--><h10><span id="details"></span></h10>
<h2>Details</h2>
<p>To achieve the project goals, students and advisors will conduct the following tasks: </p>
<ul>
  <li>review the current state of hardware and software</li> 
  <li>examine possible modifications to the hardware platform to address issues such as weather proofing, communication interface (ethernet/wi-fi), and power systems</li> 
  <li>implement any fixes or modifications to the hardware platform</li>
  <li>design a client-server software interface to control the motors from any remote computer</li> 
  <li>and implement various GUI front-end utilities to make controlling the Heliostat accessible for users who are unfamiliar with the project</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these tasks can be conducted independently, with a final integration phase taking place towards the end of the project. The integration phase will provide students with a good opportunity to review and edit the documentation that has been developed by their peers throughout the course of the project.</p>
